# Loan Application and Ledger Management System

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to input loan details, calculate EMIs (Monthly Installments), and view a detailed repayment ledger. The application consists of a React frontend with Chakra UI and a FastAPI backend.

## Installation and Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shobhit1338/HealthCRED.git
   cd HealthCRED
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server

In one terminal window, navigate to the project root directory and activate the virtual environment if not already activated:

```bash
cd backend
```


Start the backend server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Start the Frontend Server

In a separate terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will run on `http://localhost:5173` or another available port.
